         A little bit about myself - I'm currently living in Louisville, KY, working at Bellarmine University in the Institutional Research and Effectiveness department. I've dabbled in programming since I was around 12, making embarassing personal websites from scratch and creating 3d worlds in <a href="https://www.activeworlds.com/web/index.php">Active Worlds</a>. I started my "official" learning with C++ about three years ago, when I went back to school to get a degree in Computer Science.
         <br>
         <br>
         Some of my main interests include fiber arts, gaming, mental health and making music (currently playing oboe in the local <a href="http://www.rivercitiesconcertband.org/">River Cities Concert Band</a>).

         Thanks for reading!
